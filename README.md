# QuiverVisual Lorentz force special case project.
Wanted to mess about with morph::quivervisuals with some visualisation of the Lorentz force acting on a wire.
[mathplot](https://github.com/sebsjames/mathplot) must be installed in-tree with the code.

Currently, the program shows a wire (blue) a magnetic field (red) and the resultant force on the wire (green) calculated using the cross product. There is a screenshot attached in the repository. (not really proper ettiqette I know but this is just a silly program)
